This script allows the toggling off the Caps Lock Key function

features:
    Ctrl + Shft + c  (^+C) toggles the function
    If function is ON, then it de-selects the Caps Lock Key (no caps) before toggling the function off (Cap lock key disabled)
    else, it just toggles it on and off.

    The code was generated (after much prompting and more prompting by DeepSeek - https://chat.deepseek.com/)
